## Step 10. Intermediate TS (II)

### Guideline

- Ask your coordinator for a detailed description of the step content before setting a deadline.

- For each study item and each task, you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter, and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your coordinator a report including the following items:
  1. Links to all your posts during the last week specifying the relevant task or study item for each link, and also mention the exact date that each one of them were posted.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last week?

  You will have a session with a technical mentor based on your report.

1. Pass this exercise at exercism.org in the **TypeScript Track**:

   - Simple Cipher

   Learn how to run tests for these steps, and run all available tests in the spec file (remove the "x" from the beginning of each "xit").

   - Use your GitHub as source control.
   - Publish it on your JSFiddle account.

2. Enhance the project you developed in previous step by adding functionality for sorting and categorization buttons. You can refer to [this video](https://youtu.be/jYQa_VE_fVo?si=UG_qa_ZTdUfhYjVU) as a guide for how it should operate.
   - Use GitHub as your source control and showcase your project on GitHub Pages.
   
3. Pass all lessons on TypingClub.com with 5 stars up to **lesson 429**.

4. Exactly **7 days** before your deadline, ask your coordinator to schedule a live presentation session for you on your deadline day.

5. Hold your step presentation on LinkedIn. Guidelines on how to present are provided on [this page](https://github.com/cs-internship/cs-internship-spec/blob/master/courses/presentation-guidelines.md).
