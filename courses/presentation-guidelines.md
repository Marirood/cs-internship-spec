# Guidelines for LinkedIn Live Presentation

You are expected to give a **20-minute presentation** on LinkedIn Live about the content of your step. Presenting on LinkedIn not only shares your knowledge but also helps you **expand your professional network, strengthen your online presence, and build your personal brand** in a professional environment.

## 1. Preparing for Your Presentation
- Start by watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM47EKwACy4&feature=youtu.be) to understand how LinkedIn Live works.  
- To host a LinkedIn Live, your account must meet the following requirements (detailed [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a568503)):  
  - At least **150 connections**  
  - Account age **over 30 days**  

To check if you already have access:  
1. Go to your [LinkedIn Dashboard](https://www.linkedin.com/dashboard/).  
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page.  
3. Look for **LinkedIn Live**:  
   - If it says **Available**, you can go live directly.  
   - If it doesnâ€™t appear, for **Step 1 only**, you can use **Microsoft Teams** instead.  

## 2. Platform Guidelines
- **Step 1**: Microsoft Teams is allowed if LinkedIn Live access isnâ€™t available yet.  
- **From Step 2 onwards**: All presentations should be on LinkedIn Live.  
- **Tip**: In Step 1, even if you use Microsoft Teams for your presentation, start growing your connections and optimizing your profile early to ensure smooth access to LinkedIn Live for future presentations.

## 3. After Your Presentation
1. **Record your presentation** and share it along with the **title and description** in the *"CS Internship - Coordination -> General"* group, tagging your coordinator. These recordings will later be published on YouTube.  
2. After your live session, **take a screenshot of the comments** on your live post and share it in the same group and tag your coordinator. This helps your coordinator track attendance of your live presentation.  

## 4. Why LinkedIn Live Matters
Presenting on LinkedIn is not just about sharing content:  
- **Network Growth**: Your presentation can attract like-minded professionals and potential collaborators.  
- **Professional Visibility**: Live sessions help you establish a strong virtual presence and credibility in your field.  
- **Skill Development**: Public speaking and presenting to a professional audience strengthen communication and confidence.  
- **Opportunities**: Engaging content can open doors to mentorship, collaborations, or even career opportunities.  

## 5. Publication
All presentations will be published on the [CS Internship YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@csinternship8859).  

Good luck ðŸš€
